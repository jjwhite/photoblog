One benefit of  making an effort to take more photographs is that you end up with gems like this one.  My son likes to make odd faces and having my camera on hand allowed me to capture this one.  As the way that I look at photography has changed, I have become a huge proponent of the best camera is the one you have with you.  In this case I did have my main camera with me but I've also been using my smartphone more often.
