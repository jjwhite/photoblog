I took this photo while waiting for the fireworks to start (see my last post).  The kids were getting a little rambunctious so I decided to snap a few shots of them as they were making faces.  Sometimes, your job as a parent is simply to provide some entertainment during the down time.  I've found that bringing out the camera can sometimes chase away the boredom even if it's just for a few minutes.
