When you think 4th of July in the United States fireworks are usually pretty high up on the list of things you think of next.  I've always been impressed with good fireworks photos since they can be so difficult to achieve.  I've attempted to take some good quality photos in the past but with very little luck since I was not prepared.  I was trying to shoot with a really fast shutter speed thinking that I would "freeze" the fireworks.  The problem is that this did not result in the photos I expected.  This time around, I did some research and discovered that long exposure is the key...that and a good tripod.  I set up my camera on a tripod and set the shutter speed to BULB.  This way I could time the exposure to the exact length I wanted depending on what the show presented me.  At first I attempted some really fancy stuff ([http://www.diyphotography.net/long-exposure-fireworks-tutorial/](http://www.diyphotography.net/long-exposure-fireworks-tutorial))  but the results were very so-so so I simplified things and ended up getting some really nice shots.  This one is probably my favorite.
