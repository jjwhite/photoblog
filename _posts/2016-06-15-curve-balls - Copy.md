If there is one guarantee in life, it's that you never know what might be coming around the corner.  Life is like that fastball pitcher who will throw you the same pitch over and over again.  Lulling you into a false sense of comfort before dropping a curveball that leaves you standing with your mouth agape.  We recently learned that we will be adding a new member to our family in about 6 months.  With a 10 and 8 year old already, this came as a bit of a surprise.  When we were ready to announce the pregnancy on social media we decided to have a little bit of fun and play off of that surprise.  This photo is the result.  Although it isn't all that great from a technical perspective, I really love the kids' facial expressions since this pretty much exactly captures how I felt when I found out!
