<br/>
You really can't understand it until you have kids of your own, but they grow up fast.  Like, REALLY fast.  My daughter is 7 and might as well be my shadow, following me around pretty much from the moment I get home in the evening until she goes to bed.  And if I'm being honest, this can, and does, get on my nerves more than I care to admit.  But when I see this smile I'm reminded that this time does not last forever.  Soon she will be a teenager and will probably want nothing to do with me.  Right now, however, she's still more than willing to hold my hand and pull me off to some unknown adventure.  Who am I to say no to that.

I took this photo while we were visiting the location of a wedding that I was going to be shooting in a few weeks.  My daughter was getting anxious to go home and was pulling me along towards the car.  I really wanted to get more of my own hand and arm in the shot so that it was more obvious that she was holding my hand but I was limited in that I didn't have much time to get the shot and I only had a 35mm lens to work with so I wasn't able to get a wider angle at the time.  Thankfully, that smile carries the photo by itself.
