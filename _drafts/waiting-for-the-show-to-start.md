When you're trying to be the documentary photographer for your own family you sometimes have to remember that the majority of your time spent together happens in the spaces between events when you are just waiting.  These are the times when you have to be creative in order to keep everyone from getting bored and, in some cases (if your kids are anything like mine), keep the peace! I've found that a few rounds of "make a weird face" can help ease that "waiting" tension pretty quickly!
